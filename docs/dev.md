#### dev

----

Start a Liberty server in dev mode. This goal also invokes the `create-server`, `install-feature`, and `install-apps` goals before starting the server. **Note:** This goal is designed to be executed directly from the Maven command line.

Dev mode provides three key features. Code changes are immediately detected, recompiled, and picked up by your running server. Unit and integration tests are run on demand when you press Enter in the command terminal where dev mode is running, or optionally on every code change to give you instant feedback on the status of your code. Finally, it allows you to attach a debugger to the running server at any time to step through your code.

###### Examples

Start dev mode.
```
$ mvn liberty:dev
```

Start dev mode and run tests automatically after every code change.
```
$ mvn liberty:dev -DhotTests=true
```

Start dev mode and listen on a specific port for attaching a debugger (default is 7777).
```
$ mvn liberty:dev -Ddebug.port=8787
```

Start dev mode without allowing to attach a debugger.
```
$ mvn liberty:dev -Ddebug=false
```

###### Additional Parameters

The following are the parameters supported by this goal in addition to the [common server parameters](common-server-parameters.md#common-server-parameters) and the [common parameters](common-parameters.md#common-parameters).

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| --------  | ----------- | -------  |
| hotTests | If set to `true`, run unit and integration tests automatically after every change. The default value is `false`. | No |
| skipTests | If set to `true`, do not run any tests in dev mode. The default value is `false`. | No |
| skipUTs | If set to `true`, skip unit tests. The default value is `false`. If the project packaging type is `ear`, unit tests are always skipped. | No |
| skipITs | If set to `true`, skip integration tests. The default value is `false`.  | No |
| debug | Whether to allow attaching a debugger to the running server. The default value is `true`. | No |
| debug.port | The debug port that you can attach a debugger to. The default value is `7777`. | No |

###### System Properties for Integration Tests
